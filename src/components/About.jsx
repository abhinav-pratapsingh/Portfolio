                    <p>Hi, I'm a web developer with a strong foundation in backend development. I've worked with technologies like Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to build robust APIs and scalable server-side applications.

                    <br/>Currently, I'm diving into frontend development â€” learning React and building responsive, interactive user interfaces. I'm passionate about creating full-stack solutions that are both functional and user-friendly.

                    <br/>I'm always learning, experimenting, and working toward becoming a well-rounded full-stack developer.</p>
